## 🌟 Core Pillars & Real-World Solutions

1. **Caregiver Data-Entry Reduction (Quick Memory Setup):**
   - Natural language extractor parses free-form sentences into structured memory nodes across 7 categories (Occupation, Food, Places, Festivals, Music, Family, Hobbies).
   - Structured `[Accept / Edit / Reject]` pipeline guarantees unapproved AI suggestions never reach the patient.

2. **Memory Confidence, Provenance & Outdated Controls:**
   - Explicit provenance tracking: `🛡️ Caregiver Entered`, `✨ Caregiver Approved AI`, `📥 Imported History`.
   - Lifecycle controls: `Active`, `Archived`, `Deleted`, and `★ Primary / Important`.
   - **Guaranteed Exclusion:** Archived memories remain in caregiver records but are strictly 100% excluded from cognitive activities.

3. **AI Activity Traceability & Problem Reporting:**
   - Memory attribution: *"Why was this activity created? Based on: [Memory snippet]"*.
   - `[⚠️ Report a Problem]` modal permanently flags and excludes unsuitable activities.

4. **Female-First Audio Companion & Voice Guidance:**
   - Prioritizes calming female voices by default across all patient interactions (instructions, questions, supportive feedback, "Hear Again").
   - Paced at 0.88x speed for elderly cognitive comfort.
   - Non-discouraging feedback variations for mistakes (*"Good try. Let's try another one."*).

5. **Multilingual Capability Matrix & Honest Fallbacks:**
   - Explicit capability detection per language (Text, Voice Synthesis, Speech Input, AI Generation).
   - Honest fallback: Regional dialects without native browser TTS voices (e.g. Khasi, Manipuri) gracefully use high-contrast elder visual cards and harmonic sound chimes.

6. **Offline Session Synchronization Queue:**
   - Caches completed sessions in `localStorage` during network drops.
   - Automatically flushes to the database on reconnection with zero data loss.

7. **Platform Telemetry & Medical Claim Disclaimer:**
   - Live health status for Network, AI Engine, Female Voice, Speech Input, Database, and Auto-Sync.
   - Mandatory Clinical Notice and Intended Use disclosure.
